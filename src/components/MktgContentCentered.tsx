          <h3>For your home</h3>
          <p>
            Regular cleaning and maintenance of your home's exterior surfaces improves your home's:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Beauty. </strong>Restore your home's original curb appeal, view your
              surroundings through crystal clear windows and make your home more appealing and
              inviting for your family and guests.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Safety. </strong> Get rid of the layer of green moss, algae and mildew on your
              stone steps, walkways and dock before someone falls and gets hurt!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Longevity. </strong> Bacteria can accumulate and damage your siding, shingles
              and deck. Cleaning those surfaces regularly extends the useful life of those surfaces,
              saving you money.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functionality & Longevity {">"} Exterior. </strong> A clogged gutter can cause
              water to pool and rot your roof. A leaky gutter system allows water to fall and
              accumulate in unexpected places, possibly doing damage to your lawn or gardens.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety, Functionality & Longevity {">"} Interior. </strong> Clogged clothes
              dryer vents cause thousands of fires each year in the US. Additionally, clogged dryer
              vents can cause carbon monoxide to be vented into the home instead of to the outside.
              Clogged vents put extra strain on the machine, decreasing its useful life and
              resulting in impaired performance. If you begin to notice that your clothes are still
              damp after a complete cycle, your dryer vent needs to be cleaned. Luckily for you,
              Crystal Clear Shine is the #1 dryer vent cleaner in Wilmington!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>For your business</h3>
          <p>
            Regular cleaning and maintenance of your business' exterior surfaces and vehicle fleet
            benefits your business in many ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Beauty. </strong>Restore your business' original curb appeal and make your
              retail space inviting to existing and new customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professionalism. </strong>Maintaining a clean and well-kept retail space and
              fleet of vehicles conveys to your clients the level of your business' professionalism
              and attention to detail.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety. </strong>Avoid slip-and-fall accidents and the potential for related
              liability from having an employee or customer slip on a moss- or algae-covered parking
              lot, driveway or sidewalk.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>You should hire a team of professionals</h2>
          <p>
            It takes time and experience to develop the skills needed to do this work properly. If
            you're not familiar with your pressure washing equipment, you can dent and damage your
            decks, siding and even your windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            A team of professionals does this work on a daily basis. They come prepared with the
            skills and experience, as well as the equipment and supplies, needed to clean your
            surfaces efficiently, effectively and safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            True professionals are also licensed, bonded and insured, as we are at Crystal Clear
            Shine. Accidents sometimes do happen to the best of us. Because we are fully bonded and
            insured, we can set them right.

            to the Wilmington area, relocating his business in the process. To Seth, coming back to
            North Carolina felt like coming home.
